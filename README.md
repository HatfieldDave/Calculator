# The Unconventional Calculator

This is a project I made in the Udemy course, JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2022 (Beginner + Advanced) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

## How It works

The calculator starts with a default result of 0.
When you enter a number the calculator takes the number you enter and the button you click and executes the arithmetic. That math becomes the new result. The next number in the box is then applied to the new result, eg. result reads 0, user inputs 5, clicks the sum button, new result is 5, user inputs 10, clicks the multiply button, new result is 50.

## Things to add

- Clear button // As of now user must refresh the page.
